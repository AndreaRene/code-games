# Build-a-Website Challenge

## Overview

**Build-a-Website Challenge** is the first in a series of interactive games aimed at beginner developers. This game helps players practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by reordering HTML elements to form a valid webpage structure. Through engaging gameplay, users learn core web development concepts and gain hands-on experience. This game is designed to be a fun and educational tool for those just starting out in web development or for anyone looking to refresh their skills.

## Features

### HTML

- **Drag-and-drop interface**: Players can drag HTML tags from a sidebar and reorder them correctly in the middle area.
- **Real-time feedback**: Players get immediate visual feedback if they place an element in the wrong or right order, helping reinforce learning.
- **Live code preview**: As players build the correct HTML structure, a live code editor shows the generated HTML, allowing them to see how the code forms the webpage.
- **Progressive difficulty**: Each stage increases in complexity, introducing more tags and nested structures to challenge and educate users at a gradual pace.

### CSS and JavaScript (Upcoming Features)

- **CSS stages**: After mastering HTML, players will be introduced to CSS. They'll learn how to apply styles using CSS properties, flexbox, and grid systems.
- **JavaScript stages**: The final stages will introduce interactive elements like event handling and DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

### Additional Features

- **Stage-based learning**: The game is broken into stages that focus on different aspects of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Players must complete one stage before moving on to the next, ensuring a solid foundation.
- **Hint system**: For players who get stuck, a hint system will provide guidance without giving away the solution.

## How to Play

1. **Drag the HTML element tags** from the left sidebar.
2. **Drop them into the correct order** in the middle section to construct a valid webpage structure.
3. As you reorder the elements, **watch the live preview or view the generated HTML code** in the right section to see your changes reflected in real time.
4. **Advance through levels**: Once you successfully complete the current stage, you'll move on to more complex levels that introduce additional HTML elements, nested structures, and eventually CSS and JavaScript.

### Game Objective

The goal is to help players understand the correct structure of an HTML document, how to style elements with CSS, and how to add interactivity with JavaScript. Each stage teaches essential web development concepts in a hands-on, engaging way.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The foundation for structuring the game interface and building the HTML-based puzzles.
- **CSS3**: Used for the layout and design of the game, including flexbox and grid systems for responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Implements drag-and-drop functionality, real-time feedback, and live preview.
- **React**: Handles the component structure of the game, ensuring an interactive and dynamic user experience.
- **Vite**: The build tool used to bundle the project, offering a fast development environment and optimized production builds.

## Roadmap / Future Features

- **More advanced stages**: Adding stages that cover more advanced HTML5 elements, such as forms, multimedia elements, and semantic HTML.
- **CSS stages**: Introduce styling challenges using selectors, properties, and layout techniques like flexbox and grid.
- **JavaScript stages**: Teach DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic interactivity by building simple components.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a scoring system based on speed and accuracy, with a leaderboard for users to track their progress.
- **Hints and Tutorials**: For players who get stuck, hints and mini-tutorials will provide assistance to ensure learning continues.
